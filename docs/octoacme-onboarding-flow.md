# OctoAcme — Onboarding Flow

## Purpose
Provide a structured, role-aware onboarding experience so that new team members can contribute effectively and understand their collaborative touchpoints as quickly as possible.

> **Rationale (issue #4):** Faster onboarding and clearer accountability are core goals of the expanded roles documentation. This flow supplements the personas document and ensures new joiners understand both their own responsibilities and how they connect to other roles.
