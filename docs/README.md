# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This directory houses the living documentation for how OctoAcme manages cross-functional projects.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme's project management processes are grounded in clear roles, iterative delivery, and standardized workflows that foster transparency and consistent outcomes across cross-functional teams. Every project involves a dedicated Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead, alongside Developers, Product Managers, Quality Assurance (QA), and relevant stakeholders. Each persona's responsibilities—from coordinating delivery and managing risks (PM), defining product vision and prioritization (Product Manager), to implementing and testing features (Developers)—are well-defined to ensure alignment, efficiency, and stakeholder engagement throughout the project lifecycle.

Workflows at OctoAcme are structured yet adaptable, designed to take a project from idea through execution and retrospective review. Initiation begins with a Project One-pager and stakeholder alignment, followed by meticulous planning involving backlog creation, risk identification, and definition of success metrics. During execution, teams use GitHub project boards to track tasks, leveraging a pull request (PR) workflow focused on small, reviewable increments, automation for CI/CD, and strict requirements for reviews and acceptance criteria. Quality assurance is woven into these workflows, with mandatory unit and integration tests, continuous security scanning, and thorough manual QA when needed.

Communication is a foundational pillar, with a cadence that ensures both operational alignment and stakeholder awareness. Teams hold daily standups and weekly syncs to discuss progress, risks, and blockers, while PMs and Product Managers coordinate roadmap and status updates through regular meetings and documentation. Stakeholder communication is further supported by templates for weekly status and incident reporting, emphasizing clarity, accountability, and rapid escalation when necessary.

Continuous improvement is formalized via regular retrospectives following each sprint or release, where teams reflect on successes, identify gaps, and document actionable improvements. Action items are tracked in the backlog or project board, and their impact is reviewed in subsequent cycles. This loop of defined roles, tested workflows, quality gates, and structured communication underpins OctoAcme's ability to deliver reliable, customer-focused solutions while encouraging a culture of learning and process optimization.

Our approach includes:
- **Initiation**: define goals, stakeholders, and priorities
- **Planning**: break down work, estimate, align resources
- **Execution & Tracking**: manage progress, demos, blockers
- **Risk & Communication**: proactive risk management & transparent comms
- **Release & Deployment**: standard checklists, playbooks
- **Retrospectives & Improvement**: learn from every sprint/release
- **Clear roles and personas** for responsibilities
